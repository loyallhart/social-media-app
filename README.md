# social-media-app

  ## Description
  I am exploring building an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I am using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. Because this application won’t be deployed, I have created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.

  ## Installation
  You will need to install the following:
  - dotenv
  - mongoose
  - express
  
  ## Usage
  This project be used to create new users, add friends to users, post thoughts, post reactions, get single users, update users, get all users and get all thoughts.
